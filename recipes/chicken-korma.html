            <li>3 tbsp double cream</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut the chicken breast into bite-sizeed pieces and season with black pepper and put into a non-metallic bowl.
                Stir in yoghurt, cover with cling film and chill for minimum of 30 minutes. Ideally 2-6 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in a large, non-stick sauce pan and add onions, garlic and ginger.
                Cover and cook on a low heat for 15 minutes until very soft and lightly coloured. Stir the onions occassionally so they don't stick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once onions are softened, stir in crush cardamon seeds, cumin, coriander, tumeric, chilli powder and the bay leaf.
                Pinch of the edges of the cloves and throw them into the pan. Cook spices and the onions for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in flour, sugar and 1/2 a teaspoon of salt, and slowly pour the water into the pan, stirring constantly.
                Bring to a gentle simmer, then cover and cook for 10 minutes. Remove pan from the heat and take out the bay leaf.
                Blitz the onion mixture with a stick blender until smooth as possible. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain the chicken in a colander over the sink, shaking a few times to allow the chicken
                to only have a light coating of yoghurt. Place a non-stick frying pan on the heat, add sauce and bring to simmer.
                Add the chicken pieces and cream and cook for 10 minutes or until chicken is tender and cooked through. Check chicken pieces
                after 8 minutes to make sure no pink is remaining.
            </li>
            <li>Serve at once with the coriander</li>
        </ol>
